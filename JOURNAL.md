# May 21st: Brainstorming and Finding Parts

- Brainstormed different ideas on what I could make
- Decieded on something model rocket related but searched the web for help
- Eventually came up with my own idea:
- Model rocket with a build in payload, altimeter, and 2 servo controlled fins so I could guide it back similar to a plane
- The idea for this came from the Space Shuttle

- Then worked on finding parts
- Eventually settled on the ESP32 board which has wifi control
- Allows me to control it from a different device
- Then decided on 2 Adafruit Servos to use for the fins
- Next Steps:
- Starting to create the body of the rocket

**Total time spent: 1.5h**
