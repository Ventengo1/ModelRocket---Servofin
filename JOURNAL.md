# May 21st: Brainstorming and Finding Parts

- Brainstormed different ideas on what I could make
- Decieded on something model rocket related but searched the web for help
- Eventually came up with my own idea:
- Model rocket with a build in payload, altimeter, and 2 servo controlled fins so I could guide it back similar to a plane
- The idea for this came from the Space Shuttle

- Then worked on finding parts
- Eventually settled on the ESP32 board which has wifi control
- Allows me to control it from a different device
- Then decided on 2 Adafruit Servos to use for the fins
- Next Steps:
- Starting to create the body of the rocket

**Total time spent: 1.5h**

# May 22st: Brainstorming and Finding Parts

- Created the nose cone, fuselage with a launch lug, and my nose cone coupler
- Body of the rocket will be 8.5in
- Then I will attach nose cone to the coupler
- Then attach Nose cone to body of rocket
- Made sure that the body of the rocket has a big enough diameter so that the ESP32 board could fit

- After this spent about 30min researching different engines to use
- After I sliced the 3 things I made, they alone ended up using about 60g of filament so the total weight of the rocket is going to be ~ 100g
- Decided to use engine with 5-6oz maximum lift weight
- Settled on the Estes C11-3 rocket engine
- Has 22.10 Newtons (4.9lbs) of thrsut
- 3 second time delay for ejection charge
- Max Lift Weight = 6oz (170g)
- Issue is though the engine diameter is 24mm
- So will make the engine mount 24mm to fit the engine perfectly

**Total time spent: 1.5h**
