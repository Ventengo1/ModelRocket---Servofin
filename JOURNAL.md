# May 21st: Brainstorming and Finding Parts

- Brainstormed different ideas on what I could make
- Decieded on something model rocket related but searched the web for help
- Eventually came up with my own idea:
- Model rocket with a build in payload, altimeter, and 2 servo controlled fins so I could guide it back similar to a plane
- The idea for this came from the Space Shuttle

- Then worked on finding parts
- Eventually settled on the ESP32 board which has wifi control
- Allows me to control it from a different device
- Then decided on 2 Adafruit Servos to use for the fins
- Next Steps:
- Starting to create the body of the rocket

**Total time spent: 1.5h**

# May 22nd: Brainstorming and Finding Parts

- Created the nose cone, fuselage with a launch lug, and my nose cone coupler
- Body of the rocket will be 8.5in
- Then I will attach nose cone to the coupler
- Then attach Nose cone to body of rocket
- Made sure that the body of the rocket has a big enough diameter so that the ESP32 board could fit

- After this spent about 30min researching different engines to use
- After I sliced the 3 things I made, they alone ended up using about 60g of filament so the total weight of the rocket is going to be ~ 100g
- Decided to use engine with 5-6oz maximum lift weight
- Settled on the Estes C11-3 rocket engine
- Has 22.10 Newtons (4.9lbs) of thrsut
- 3 second time delay for ejection charge
- Max Lift Weight = 6oz (170g)
- Issue is though the engine diameter is 24mm
- So will make the engine mount 24mm to fit the engine perfectly

# May 23rd: Working on Fin section of rocket and finalizing servos

- Worked on figuring out how servo would fit
- Realized that I would need the servo the be at a veritcal orientation
- And for it to be smaller
- Oringally was using this servo:https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808061785803.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.11.51c08752aypQdM&algo_pvid=51e031bd-3c3f-4e6a-a8a3-cedbc3230a41&algo_exp_id=51e031bd-3c3f-4e6a-a8a3-cedbc3230a41-10&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%221380%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%2C%22orig_sl_item_id%22%3A%221005008248100555%22%2C%22orig_item_id%22%3A%221005007442852333%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%214.35%211.97%21%21%2131.14%2114.14%21%402103277f17480478097133871edb30%2112000044371515279%21sea%21US%210%21ABX&curPageLogUid=WFO2d8nIymAD&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A
- But now could use this one:https://www.adafruit.com/product/169
- Newer one is smaller and lighter which will help the rocket greatly
- Either way, added areas on my current design for the bottom part of the rocket

# May 24th: Finishing 3D Model for Fin section of rocket
 - Finished up work on the fin section
 - Decided to add 2 fins as 4 would result in too many servos
 - One issue is that the servos get in the way of most of the launch ejection charge
 - Going to find a way around this by adding a tube
 - Also made my engine mount work for a 24mm rocket engine
 - Added 2 fins which aren't connected yet because they will be attached to the servo
