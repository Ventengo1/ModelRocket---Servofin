# Servo Controlled Model Rocket

This is a model rocket with servo controlled fins and a ailtitude tracker. It is built with a ESP32 to for wifi and bluetooth control, a BMO280 for the alitude sensor, a PCA9685 as the servo driver board, and 2 SG90 micro servos. The project is made for and funded by Hack Club's Highway program. 

Disclaimer: Artificial intelligence was used in the some parts of the making of this project's code. Much of it was found from tutorials on the web, forums, and reddit. As such, that code is exempt from the GNU GPL v3 license the rest of the project is under.

In the future, I want to take this project to a whole new level with oritentation controlled servos and landing legs which deploy (SpaceX style).
